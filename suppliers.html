                    NuestroCaffÃ¨ specialises in Damn Fine Coffee but thatâ€™s just the tip of the milk wand.
                    Whether your favourite brew is safe and standard, or a wee bit out there, weâ€™ve got you covered. Make the most of our generous extras and really shake things upâ€¦ Triple shot Hazelnut latte perhaps? Or Iced Mocha with a dash of cinnamon? Why not! Think of us as your portal into a world of coffee adventures and enjoy the ride.
                </p>

                <h1>Our Suppliers</h1>
                <p class="pt-3">
                    We choose to source 100% Fairtrade coffee, so the farmers that grow our beans get vital support 
                    to improve the living conditions and livelihoods in their communities.  They receive a guaranteed minimum price 
                    for their beans which helps protect them from fluctuating market rates. 
                    We consider this part of our responsibility to do things the right way and give back to the people 
                    who provide the beautiful bean that means so much to all of us.
                </p>

                <h1>Our Customers</h1>
                <p class="pt-3">
                    We know that your coffee is more than just a drink. Itâ€™s your local pick me up â€“ giving 
                    you a great start to your day or an opportunity to reset it. 
                    Our take-away set up means that customers stand and chat to our baristas or other customers 
                    and we know that five-minute 
                    interaction has become a valuable part of the day for many people. Regular brain teasers, 
                    competitions and charitable initiatives 
                    all add to the great vibe that goes with our great coffee.
